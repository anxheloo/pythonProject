#Lambda - same as functions but we dont have to name them, are like anonymos functions

#Lambda, 1(first)-paranthesis: mathematical expressions, 2(second)-paranthesis: value we want to pass
result = (lambda x: x**2)(5)

print(result)

#we can also print it directly without storing it in a variable
print((lambda x: x**2)(5))
