    What is machine learning?

    Machine learning is the ability of the computer to use and analyze data to make intelligent predictions and decisions based on data
    without being programmed.

    ML has 2 methods: Supervised Learning and Unsupervized Learning
        -SL is the method when we give the input and we know the output target, so we analyze it closely and make adjustment. Most Used.
        -UL is the method when pc analyze the data, learn and find relations between them without a data scientist adjusting it along the way.


    - What is supervised learning?

    Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm learns to map input data to output data based on a labeled training dataset.
    In supervised learning, each training example consists of an input value (also known as features) and a corresponding output value (also known as labels or targets).

    The goal of supervised learning is to train a model to predict the correct output value given a new input value.
    The model is trained by minimizing the difference between its predicted output values and the true output values in the training data.
    This is typically done using a loss function that measures the error between the predicted output and the true output.

    Supervised learning can be used for both regression and classification tasks.

    In regression, the goal is to predict a continuous output value, such as predicting the price of a house based on its features.
    In classification, the goal is to predict a discrete output value, such as whether an email is spam or not based on its features.

    Some common supervised learning algorithms include linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, support vector machines,
    and neural networks. Supervised learning has many real-world applications, such as image classification, speech recognition, and recommendation systems.
